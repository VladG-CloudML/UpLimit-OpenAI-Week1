Some say that it's already here. Wildfires across Canada are burning hotter and faster than ever. I'm Adrienne Lamb, the host of the podcast World on Fire. In our latest episode, we'll meet the reporters who run towards the danger and hear the stories of their harrowing escapes and finding resilient communities. That's World on Fire, wherever you get your podcasts. This is a CBC Podcast. Hey there, I'm Rosemary Barton. This week on At Issue, the podcast edition for Thursday, June 22nd. The House of Commons has adjourned for the summer, but there's already talk of a cabinet shuffle in the coming weeks. Will you shuffle your cabinet before the fall sitting? I'm going into a cabinet meeting right now. We're going to have a lot of good work to do and I have nothing to announce. Cateau Canada has learned the groundwork for a cabinet change has been laid after a few difficult months for the government. In an attempt to move some ministers struggling in portfolios and to send a signal to Canadians, the government has not run out of steam. So this week we're asking, is a cabinet shuffle in the cards for the Liberals? How else could the government show it still has the energy to get the job done? Chantelle Ibera and your co-in, Althea Raj, join me to talk about that, plus what's to be made of the results of Monday's four by-elections. I'm not going to make you say who's in, who's out. We're not going to do that. Don't worry, because I know you all would throw things at me. But I will ask the question whether the government needs to demonstrate something to Canadians who do seem to think that they've just been around a long time and are a bit stuck. And what might that be, that tools, Chantelle? Possibly whether a cabinet shuffle is something that will work miracles, as the mood for change sets in, is very dubious. I've not seen very many cabinet shuffles result in a sea change in attitudes towards the government, although it is good practice once in a while to kind of shake out your cabinet. But not for the reasons of coming back. I think many Liberals this week would say, well, maybe Canadians are getting tired of us, but they're still voting for us. We did OK in those by-elections. Our vote is resilient. So it isn't as if we are looking at a cabinet shuffle to save us from a huge peril. That might be a bit of a short read on the part of the Liberals, but still those by-election results worked out to be a narrative-busting event for the notion that the Liberals were going nowhere very, very fast. OK, and we're going to talk about the by-elections in the next segment, so don't go too far down that rabbit hole. And I should say that if you want to play the game of who's in and who's out of cabinet, please don't let me stop you. I just know you all very well, and it seems unlikely. So, Andrew, could a cabinet shuffle \u2013 I mean, sometimes that just presents a different image to Canadians, right? And sometimes that sort of just changes the way people, including the media, start talking about government. But is there something else that might be needed here? Well, that's virtually all that cabinets and cabinet shuffles are good for is presenting an image. You know, if they really wanted to send a signal of change and invigoration, et cetera, they'd cut the cabinet in half. We don't need to have 40 cabinet ministers. The fact that we do tells you all you need to know about what cabinet has become. It's essentially for signaling to various demographics that you're on their side. It's hiring spokespeople who can present the government's message effectively. But it's not actually for ministers who will actually have serious responsibilities, serious roles, serious autonomy and independence. So, yeah, cabinet shuffles give us in the media something to speculate about and show how in the know we are. But they don't actually \u2013 I agree with Chantelle. I can't remember the last one that actually signaled something substantive and serious in terms of a change of direction. This government, I think, will be ill-disposed, for the reason Chantelle suggested, to take any bold steps because they have very little to lose and very little to gain. Voting patterns now are so entrenched, certainly between the right and the left, that there's not a lot to be gained from that. They can win elections. They can win minorities, as we've seen in the last two elections with 30-odd percent of the vote. They've got 30 percent that simply won't desert them no matter what. And if they can govern again with the NDP support, why would they want to make any bold new ventures or take any chances? Elfie? So I tend to see things a little bit differently. Good. I don't disagree with some of what Andrew said. But I do actually think we're going to have a much bigger cabinet shuffle than we've had in a long while. Like, we really haven't had a cabinet shuffle since the last election because we only basically had a little bit of tinkering in last August. And yes, cabinet is all the things Andrew mentioned in terms of regional representation. And you keep members in cabinet who are reflective of certain communities that might be good for fundraising. But at the end of the day, cabinet ministers are still in charge of their departments. And who you put in charge of your department can actually make a difference. You know, Sean Fraser, for example, seems to be a much better or more productive immigration minister than immigration ministers that we had previously. So I think that we can't dismiss that part. The other part of making a cabinet is about caucus management. You have a lot of actually pretty competent people who ran in 2015 for Justin Trudeau under the impression, probably for many, that they were going to make it into cabinet and haven't yet still. And they're getting a little impatient. And just to ensure that there is mobility in the ranks and that the caucus is happy, I think that that will be bigger than we expect. The trouble, though, is it's kind of hard to dump people once they have been in cabinet for a while. So unless they tell you they're walking out the door, it can be a little tricky and lead to some unpleasantness, as we saw with Jodie Wilson-Raybould or Mark Garneau. So suppose for speculation's sake that the Christian Freelance moves on to something else and there is a change at finance. That's a major change. That's a major cabinet shuffle. Suppose that all it is about is shuffling a few chairs to make caucus members happy and to dispose of Marco Mendicino, who has been having a hard time in his portfolio. That really is something that no Canadian is going to stop his or her vacation over to say, gee, this is a new government. It's now got energy. Marco is no longer around the cabinet table. Yes, some ministers make a difference. For instance, Stephen Gilbo at the environment does make a difference to voting prospects for the government in Quebec. But that is where he is. So a lot of the current ministers who are strong, do you really want to replace them unique or shuffle him in a lesser role? But nobody's suggesting that they're still like 40 members. I know. But what I'm trying to say is the question was, will it change the optics on the government? My take on this is if it's really substantial, yes, people will pay attention. But if they're shuffling a few chairs because they have talent and caucus, by the time those names are named, they may not be in government anymore. We're trying to set the bar for when we're going to come in really during our summer holidays to talk about it in part. Andrew, would prerogation do it? Would a throne speech be a more substantive message that there is something that needs to happen here? Or maybe like maybe none of these things are necessary. I don't know. Well, I mean, we've seen them use prerogations before to get out of hot water. And they're in a bit of hot water right now. So that would be nervy to try that again. I'm not sure you can use that, I guess, to get out of a public inquiry. But we shall see. No, look, there's two things that are really bedeviling them. One is the sense of drift and lack of direction. You know, they had bold plans in their first government and they executed a lot of those. There's not been a lot of direction in the last couple of years. And secondly, just the sense that they're behind the eight ball. They're overwhelmed. They're, you know, way behind on judicial appointments on all kinds of things where it's just simply executing. And again, a large part of that is they're trying to run everything through the PMO. And, you know, there's only so much that a half a dozen people can do. Okay, 30 seconds or so to you, Althea, then we'll move on. Well, I agree with that last part. But I think that there's still an opportunity in a cabinet shuffle to signal the things that you're trying to tell Canadians you care about. So, for example, housing. Housing has been a big issue. Pierre Poilier, as a Conservative leader, has put that on the radar as an issue. The current housing minister, not the greatest communicator. If we have a cabinet shuffle and it's large, I would expect that Ahmed Hussain, unfortunately, gets another job. Because you need to have somebody who can go toe to toe on the issues that the government says it cares about and hasn't successfully delivered on. Welcome to another round of that issue. This week saw liberals and conservatives hold two seats apiece in Monday's federal by-elections. With four seats up for grabs, early polls suggested a slump in liberal support. But despite this, they were able to hold on to seats in Winnipeg, South Centre and Notre Dame de Grasse, Westmount. For the Conservatives, they were able to hold on to Oxford and defeat PPC leader Maxime Bernier in Port-au-Toulis group. So what should we read into these results? What do they tell us about the current political landscape and how parties maybe should adapt? Let's bring everybody back. Chantelle and Althea, Andrew, why don't you start us off? Should the Conservatives, let's start with the Conservatives because we talked about the Liberals more in the first block. Should the Conservatives be happy, relieved, concerned about how these by-elections played out? Very concerned and I would couple them with the Mississauga Lakeshore by-election last December. You see a similar pattern in all of them, or virtually all of them, where the Conservative vote is down in a by-election. Usually opposition parties do well in by-elections. But it's particularly the pattern here, which is on the one hand, bleeding support to their left, to the centre. Why do I say that? Because the support for the People's Party went down, which you would think would benefit the Tories, and yet the Tories' overall vote also went down in three of the four roddings. So that suggests that they're losing more votes than the Liberals than they're gaining from the People's Party. And equally concerning, I think, to them is that the NDP vote is down quite sharply. Now there might be a lot of reasons for that, but one of them might well be if the political strategy for the Liberals is to scare NDP voters into voting Liberal because the Conservatives are so awful and so mean and so nasty, if you've got a leader who seems to validate those fears, that's going to help that strategy. So looking at these, as I say, in by-elections after the government had taken a pounding for the last several months, for them not to improve their standing, let alone to see their standing go down, has got to be very concerning. So what do you say, Chantal, to people who say, well, it's just a by-election? Because that's certainly what Conservatives would say when you put some of those points to them. Yeah, of course, and would they be saying that if they'd improved their share of the vote? Pierre Trudeau, Justin's father, held 15 by-elections in 1978 and came out with two and lost half a dozen to the Conservatives. And a year later he was out of government. That is what happens to governments who are at the end of their rope electorally. The share of the Liberal vote actually went up. What that tells me is it's not, and stop Liberals before you think you're so great. Mostly, Pierre Poilieff is convincing Liberals who are tired with their own party to come out and vote for their party. And as Andrew points out, he's also probably convincing New Democrat voters that they're better off voting for the stronger alternative to the Conservatives. I would call that a serious, serious warning to the Conservatives and to Pierre Poilieff at this rate. He is single-handedly fighting the move for change and convincing people that while they may be tired of Justin Trudeau, they have not seen an alternative that they feel they can vote for. And are Conservatives, are they concerned, Althea, from anyone that you're talking to or hearing from? When they go out of their way to tell you that by-elections don't matter, yes, I would say they are concerned. There was an event on the Hill this week because one of our colleagues from the National Post, John Iverson, is leaving. And there were a lot of Conservatives there who made the point that by-elections don't matter and they're not at all concerned, unprompted. So that, I think, tells you what you need to know. I agree with everything that was said. I think that the decision that was made to basically go scorched earth in Portage, Lisger, this is the riding where Maxime Bernier was running, where they had a candidate basically attend rallies talking about how he believes that there's only two genders, that he would never have voted on the bill that got unanimous consent under Aaron O'Toole's leadership on conversion therapy, banning conversion therapy, where the Conservative Party used their own social media accounts to fuel the conspiracy theory on the World Economic Forum. There was this story percolating around the internet that suggests that the World Economic Forum is a world government and along with the Trudeau cabinet, they want to strip you of your private property. Sometimes it's not just private property, it's they want to install microchips in your body or whatever. That the party would use its officials' account to perpetuate this kind of theory. And at the end of the day, no matter how many times they plastered through mailings pictures of Maxime Bernier walking in a pride parade suggesting how awful this was, the PPC still got 17% of the vote. So they wasted all this effort. They hurt themselves. They gave the Liberals ammunition for the next election campaign for what purpose? Maxime Bernier says he's not going anywhere. They did not destroy him. And they have hurt themselves everywhere else in return. So yeah, go ahead, Andrew. Well, and then meanwhile in Winnipeg South Center, which is a gettable riding, I'm not saying they were likely to win it, but it's a riding that they have won in the past when they formed governments that riding is the kind of riding they need to win. They went from an 18 point margin of defeat just two years ago to a 32 point margin of defeat. I would be really worried if I was considered. Well, they didn't even try in that riding. Yeah, yeah, Chantel. Well, if you but if you don't try in writings that you win when you win, where do you try? So if the point is if the point is to kill the People's Party, I'm sure that that can be achieved since those people used to vote conservative. But that will not get you to government. So so so like surely the strategy will change that, will it not? Given all the things that you're saying here, you would think that there would be a lesson and then they would apply the lesson. And, you know, Chantel, I think those results, if the conservatives want to, are a gift to the conservatives because they send the party and its leader a message that they can use to recast. There is enough time to do it. Yeah. If they choose to read that message, I think it could be a bad gift to the liberals because it could make them think, oh, well, we're OK. Yeah, let's just keep going. Look, everything that happened all spring had no impact and that would be really dangerous. So I've always believed that the party who did best on those by elections was probably getting the more dangerous result as opposed to the party who got that message. I'm not saying that I know that people will take that message and work with it. But it's a useful one to get with so many months before another election. Andrew and Althea, both quickly. The question is whether they will take that message. The people around Polyavera, like Polyavera, I think are very heavily invested in the idea that they know best, that we've tried the other way and it didn't work, that that's just mushy, mamby-pamby stuff. We've got to give people the raw meat and get out the base. And whether they're capable of shifting from that strategy, I think is really an open question. Well, and they seem very, very focused on the people's party. I will say that as well. This is evidence of that, too. Last word to you, Althea. Well, I wonder if it will embolden some of the progressive conservatives that are in caucus who feel like they have lost their voice. Now they have something to point to when they make their arguments in caucus. Welcome back to At Issue for our final topic. We want to talk about foreign interference. The House of Commons has been adjourned for the summer with no announcements yet of a public inquiry into foreign interference. The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Dominic LeBlanc, has been meeting with opposition and House leaders and discussions have been had about how to move forward. House Leader Mark Collins says they have been constructive. I can say very clearly that those conversations are very positive, that a lot of the obstruction that we're seeing is moving away and that we're having really constructive conversations. So what will happen next? Let's bring everybody back. Chantal, Andrew and Althea. Althea, why don't you start us off? I mean, it sounds like not doing this in public is helpful. We know that Dominic LeBlanc on Thursday met with people again and we don't really know much more than that. They're not. No one's really talking about it. Do you think that they will get to a place where there will be perhaps not all party consensus, but a broader consensus around this? Well, I actually I hope there is all party consensus because we've gone through this mess for several months now in part because we did not have all party consensus. I don't think it's enough to have just the New Democrats and even the block onside. I think there is going to be a crisis of legitimacy if the conservatives don't agree. Apparently, there's another call tomorrow morning. All of this could have been avoided if they had just called a public inquiry several months ago. But it is nice to see them work cooperatively. And as you know, I think you were just kind of making a little clip there. But so much of what happens that is productive in the House of Commons only happens when the cameras are turned off. And as soon as the cameras are turned on, the show begins and nothing productive happens. So hopefully there's another lesson to be learned in all this mess. I don't believe the opposition parties would have agreed to let the House rise unless they were all reasonably certain that there would be an announcement along the lines of a public inquiry. So I figure at this point they are mostly working out the details and not the concept of a public exercise that goes beyond David Johnson's recommendation. I also think that the government, on the one hand, basically opened the door. It's hard to kick down an open door. You can only fall on your face. And basically that is what the opposition parties would be exposed to if they didn't cooperate. But at the same time, seriously, those by-election results help the liberals. There is nothing like a show of modest strength to bring everyone back to the table and back down to earth. And I think we've seen some of that happening, too. Interesting. But Althea's point is a good one, Andrew. We didn't need to be at this space after weeks and weeks and weeks of back and forth. This could have been the starting point. That's right. We didn't have consensus because no one tried to seek consensus. And we're still seeing a game of chicken going on where the opposition says call an inquiry, the government says, no, you pick the leader first, and the opposition says, well, we won't pick a leader until you call an inquiry. In a normal functioning government and opposition relationship, the government would call an inquiry and then consult the opposition on who should lead it. Maybe we're inching our way towards that. But let's remember also that not all the opposition parties are necessarily on exactly the same page here. What the shape of the inquiry for the conservatives may be very different from the NDP and or the Bloc. And a newly emboldened government coming off of those by-elections may be seeking to exploit some of those divisions. So I would stay tuned before we actually say we've got an inquiry in the bag just yet. And would the timeline be a hang up for people, too, Althea, do you think, like in terms of getting it going and then how long it goes? Well, the timeline and also how wide of breath that will be cast, which I think will determine the timeline. So if we only have an election in 2025, which is what the prime minister says he wants, then the timeline actually can be two years. Right. It's not very short. But the conservatives basically want a witch hunt that is directed at the political leadership about who knew what when and whether or not there was political interference or a lack of action, blind eyes turned on the Chinese interference question. And the New Democrats want a much broader inquiry that deals with interference by India, for example, because the NDP leader believes that he has been the target of some foreign interference. They want to expand that to include Iran and other Russia. So, you know, that is a very different inquiry than just a very narrow Chinese foreign interference inquiry over the last two years. Quickly, Chantal and Andrew. Andrew had a little comment to you, Althea. Go ahead, Chantal. I don't think that we're going to do an academia. Let's see all the foreign interference that we could be subjected to depending on the geopolitical context. But there comes a point where the person who will accept to lead that inquiry will also say, I want to have the time to do a serious job. That's right. And the powers to do so. This isn't just happening in a vacuum where you tell someone you're a serious person and we're giving you six months because that's what we want to do. So it's a bit more complex than just the parties trying to pull it in their partisan directions. Last word, Andrew. The Conservatives may well want a witch hunt. I just hope we're not confusing that with a tightly focused mandate for the inquiry that would focus on the things that a public inquiry is best suited to getting at and can only get at, which is the stuff that's going on in the current government that we otherwise wouldn't find out. There's been specific questions, specific allegations raised about what this government knew and what it did or did not do. That's the kind of question that we really need a public inquiry to get at. Can I just add very quickly that the person that they want needs to agree to do this? That's right. Exactly. Who knows if that happens. Thank you. Have a good summer. Goodbye. That's at issue with Parliament adjourned and because it's summer, we're going to take a little break. We'll be back if news warrants, otherwise sometime in September. Thanks for listening.
