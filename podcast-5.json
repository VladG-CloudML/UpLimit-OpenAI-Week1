Let's hope the answer isn't Zee-Wah-Tenay no. Ha ha, do you remember? That's a deep cut. I'm James Schreib, this is Techlinked, and this is the Chip Hell Forum post where leaker Panzerlyde posted the numbers 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. Before you think Panzerlyde forgot how to count, Liverpool FC fan and hardware leaker Copite7Kimi elaborated that the upcoming Blackwell GPUs will be cut into 5 dies, the GB202, 203, 5, 6, and 7. That naming is notable for two reasons. Lots of numbers today. 200 series usually represents dies that are re-spins, chips that are built again to be better, faster, costlier. Also, there is no 4 variant, which is typically meant to be used for the best bang for the buck GPU. Until Nvidia decided to prank us by giving that designation to the die for the 4070 and 4070Ti. Floortom symbol. Now Nvidia has replaced the X04 die designation with X05. Does the higher number here indicate lower performance as usual, or did Nvidia just want a chip that accurately referenced their favorite Mambo? Hey, no LuBega voice. A group of 6 music labels, including Sony and UMG, is suing the Internet Archive over their attempt to preserve music recorded on 78 RPM disks, a format that was discontinued in 1959. Holy cow, you know your evil when. The Archive's Great 78 project is trying to save the work of Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, and many other talented dead people, but the labels argue that because the preserved songs are already available to stream, there's no chance they'll be lost, forgotten, or destroyed. Which, you know, press X to doubt. You only can stream one version usually when there's a remaster. According to the Internet Archive, the olden times recordings still hold significant research value as artifacts and usage evidence. And that's artifacts as in unintentional sounds in audio recording, not like the Venus of Willendorf. This comes only 4 months after the Internet Archive lost another copyright lawsuit brought on by a group of large publishers who sued the Archive for making digital books available without restriction during the unprecedented global pandemic when most of the world's libraries were closed. The Archive says it plans to appeal the decision apparently unapologetic for their dastardly crimes of enabling literacy. Disney has decided to stop producing physical media in the entire country slash continent of Australia because I guess not enough things regularly perish there. The House of Mouse is instead going full throttle on Disney Plus because why charge a customer once for something they really want when you can charge them for one thing they want and thousands of things they don't want every month until they die. Obviously, this isn't just about getting people to sign up for Disney Plus and then forget to cancel their subscription. It's also because of the cost of manufacturing physical media, which I'm sure is only near zero. Disney has also pulled physical releases from some countries in Latin America and Asia where the sales numbers were underwhelming. Unfortunately for some, this trend extends beyond movies with upcoming games like Starfield not even including a physical game in their $300 constellation edition despite including a steelbook case. Alan Wake 2 is an example of a big budget game releasing digital only and even Alan Wake 1 distributor THQ Nordic is begging for discs. Please give us the discs. They're great frisbees.

I have three months to live. Dell was found to have misled consumers on monitor prices in June by Australian regulators who have now issued the company a fine of 6.46 million US bucks or 10 million Aussie billabongs. It's actually called a FINE. A FINE. From August 2019 to December 2021, Dell's Australian website suggested that shoppers could get the best price for monitors if they bundled them with other items, but that best price often turned out to be a much less desirable higher price. I totally get where Dell is coming from though. They were probably talking about the best price for them. Yeah, well, you know. Six million dollars is nothing. For Dell? In other tech companies behaving badly, News Apple will soon pay up to 500 million dollars to settle a class action lawsuit filed in 2020 accusing them of secretly throttling the performance of older iPhone models. Remember? Apple maintains that they did nothing wrong, a claim totally consistent with paying a half a billion dollars to people complaining you did something wrong. The three million claimants involved in the lawsuit could receive about 65 dollars each once all is said and done though, so this way everybody's happy. Apple didn't do anything wrong. They just felt bad. We're sorry you feel that way. Here, you can get a happy meal. In other Apple news, according to a man whose name rhymes with dark merman, Apple is planning a major update for the Apple Watch's 10th anniversary, Watch X, which sounds like porn. Despite the Roman numeral, the watch won't be a wearable Hellenic sundial, but rather a huge overhaul of the design including a micro led display, thinner watch case, magnetic band attachment system, and a blood pressure monitor. That's gotta be weird for the ninth model of the Apple Watch, which isn't even out yet and is by all reports an extremely minor upgrade to the standard Apple Watch formula. Middle child syndrome, I guess. Where's Windows 9? Microsoft went micro hard finding vulnerabilities in the industrial automation software CodeSys, objectively the sexiest kind of software. In both a presentation and a blog post, Microsoft stated these vulnerabilities could be used for remote code execution and denial of service attacks. Due to the wide use of the software, these vulnerabilities could have been used to shut down important utilities like power plants, which provide the energy that allows you to Google why Sharona was written out in the middle of the third season of Emmy-winning TV series Monk starring Tony Shalhoub. Why? It's a travesty. It's a travesty. Why Sharona? And Netflix is rolling out public testing of its new cloud gaming service for select subscribers in Canada and the UK. Why? Weird, very weird sounds. Netflix has had mobile games since last November, but now a random handful of Brits and Canucks will be able to stream exactly two games on web browsers on certain TVs, notably not including Apple TV, because the Apple Store doesn't allow cloud gaming and Tim Cook hates joy. To be clear, this is less about exclusivity and more about making sure that the new system doesn't crap up its own back if a million people log on simultaneously. What an image. Geez. That was not in the script. And you should get your friends all on simultaneously to watch this Wednesday's episode of Tech Link. You can sit all together and say nothing while you stare at your phone. It's just like dinner at my parents' house, except my mom uses an iPad."}, "podcast_summary": "In this episode of Techlinked, several topics are covered.
